# Graph Theory

These exercises cover a range of topics in graph theory and algorithms, including graph traversal,
connectivity, coloring, and minimum spanning trees. They are commonly studied in computer science 
courses related to algorithms and data structures.

Exercise 1:
  Involves creating a program that can initialize a graph and find paths between given vertices. 
  It suggests using both adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of graphs. 
  Additionally, it requires displaying all circuits (cycles) of a certain length or less within the graph.
  
Exercise 2:
  Focuses on finding strongly connected components within a directed graph. 
  It mentions using Demoucron's method, which is a commonly used algorithm for identifying these components.
  
Exercise 3:
  This exercise is about graph coloring. It requires writing a program to initialize an undirected graph 
  and then apply Welsh & Powell's algorithm to color the graph. Graph coloring is a fundamental
  problem in graph theory where the goal is to assign colors to vertices of a graph in such a way 
  that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
  
Exercise 4:
  Concerns the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. It asks for the implementation of various functions
  and a program to find a minimum spanning tree in a given undirected, connected, weighted graph. 
  The algorithms to be implemented are Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm, 
  both of which are well-known algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees.
